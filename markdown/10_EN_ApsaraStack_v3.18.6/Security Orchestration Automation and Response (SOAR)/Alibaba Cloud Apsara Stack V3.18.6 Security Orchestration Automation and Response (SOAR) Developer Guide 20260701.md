# Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) Developer Guide 20260701

Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop

## Getting started

### Process of API calls

You can use POP Gateway or the Apsara Stack API (ASAPI) gateway to call Apsara Stack API operations. From Apsara Stack Enterprise V3.16.0, POP Gateway is used by default to ensure that user experience is consistent with that in Alibaba Cloud public cloud. This topic describes how to use POP Gateway to call Apsara Stack API operations.

**Note**

You can continue to use the ASAPI gateway to call Apsara Stack API operations in Apsara Stack that is earlier than V3.16.0. For more information, see Process of API calls by using ASAPI, Generate an endpoint for ASAPI , and Obtain an SDK package for ASAPI.

**Flowchart**

**Procedure**

1. Obtain an AccessKey pair.
For more information about how to obtain the AccessKey pair, see Obtain an AccessKey pair or Obtain an AccessKey pair from STS.

**Note**

If you want to make API calls to use the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console or other Apsara Stack services, we recommend that you use the AccessKey pair of a personal account.
2. Obtain the region ID.

| <x-acs- |  |
|---|---|

|  | resourcegroupid>, |
|---|---|

Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop For more information about how to obtain the value of the RegionID parameter, see Obtain header parameters.
3. Obtain the organization ID and resource set ID.
You can call the GetOrganizationList operation to obtain the organization ID. For more information, see GetOrganizationList in Apsara Uni-manager Management Console Develop er Guide. You can call the ListResourceGroup operation to obtain the resource set ID. For more information, see ListResourceGroup in Apsara Uni-manager Management Console Develope r Guide.

**Note**

to which a resource belong. This implements isolated query of instance resources. If you do not specify the `<x-acs-organizationid>` parameter, the organization to which the current user belongs is obtained by default. If you do not specify the `<x-acs-resourcegroupid>` parameter, no resource set IDs are specified by default. If you specify a resource set ID, you must specify an organization ID.
4. Obtain the API reference of a service.
For more information about how to view, use, and obtain the developer guide of a specific service, and understand the features and usage methods of operations, see Usage notes.
5. Obtain the endpoint of the service.
6. Obtain the service SDK and use the SDK to call an operation of the service.

## Preparations

### Log on to the API Tool console

You can log on to the API Tool console from the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console.

**Prerequisites**

Before you log on to the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console, the endpoint of the console is obtained from the deployment personnel. A browser is available. We recommend that you use Google Chrome.

**Procedure**

1. Enter the URL of the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console in the address bar and
press Enter.
2. Enter your username and password.
Obtain the username and password that are used to log on to the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console from the operations administrator.

**Note**

When you log on to the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console for the first time, you must change the password of your account. For security purposes, your password must meet the minimum complexity requirements. The password must be 10 to 32 characters in length and must contain at least two of the following character types: Uppercase or lowercase letters Digits Special characters, which include ! @ # $ %
3. Click **Log On**.
4. If your account has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, perform corresponding
operations in the following scenarios: You log on to the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console for the first time after MFA is enabled by the administrator. a. On the Bind Virtual MFA Device page, bind an MFA device. b. Enter the username and password again as in Step 2 and click **Log On**. c. Enter a six-digit MFA verification code and click **Authenticate**. You have enabled MFA and bound an MFA device. Enter a six-digit MFA verification code and click **Authenticate**.

**Note**

For more information, see the **Bind a virtual MFA device to enable MFA** topic in
**Apsara Uni-manager Management Console User Guide** .
5. In the top navigation bar, choose **Products > Others > API Tool**.
Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop

### View the information about an

**operation**

When you use a service SDK to call an operation of the service, you must obtain the service name, operation name, and API version. This topic describes how to view the information about an operation.

**Background information**

The operations on the API Directory page are for reference only. For information about how to call operations, see API references of the corresponding services. If the information on the API Directory page is inconsistent with that in the API reference of the corresponding service, the information in the API reference takes precedence.

**Procedure**

1. Log on to the API Tool console.
2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **API Directory**.
3. On the **API Directory** page, select the required service from the drop-down list, enter a
keyword of an operation name in the search box, and then click Search.
4. View and record the service name, operation name, and API version.

### Obtain an AccessKey pair

AccessKey pairs are classified into AccessKey pairs assigned by Resource Access Management (RAM) and AccessKey pairs assigned by Security Token Service (STS). You can use either type of AccessKey pair for authentication when you call operations. This topic describes how to obtain an AccessKey pair that is assigned by RAM.

**Background information**

An AccessKey pair is used to verify the identity of request senders. An AccessKey pair consists of an AccessKey ID and an AccessKey secret that are used to implement symmetric encryption. The AccessKey ID is used to identify a user. The AccessKey secret is used to encrypt the signature string. You can use RAM or STS to assign an AccessKey pair for authentication. Use RAM to assign an AccessKey ID and an AccessKey secret to a third party. Use STS to assign an AccessKey ID, an AccessKey secret, and a security token to a third party. For more information, see Obtain an STS AccessKey pair. The Apsara Uni-manager Management Console provides AccessKey pairs for personal accounts or organizations. Only the administrators of level-1 organizations and operations administrators can obtain the AccessKey pairs of organizations. We recommend that you use the AccessKey pairs of personal accounts to call the operations provided by the Apsara Unimanager Management Console and cloud services. If you use the AccessKey pair of a personal account, you must add the following parameters in request headers for access control. If you do not add the parameters, an error may occur. The error indicates that permissions are insufficient.

**Warning**

The AccessKey pair of a personal account is managed by the permission system of the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console. The AccessKey pair of an organization has more permissions than the AccessKey pair of a personal account. If you want to obtain the AccessKey pair of an organization, make sure that you are authorized by an administrator. This helps ensure security.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| x-acs-regionid | The ID of the region. Example: cn-hangzhou-*. |
| x-acs-organizationid | The ID of the organization in the Apsara Uni- manager Management Console. For more information about how to obtain organization IDs, see the GetOrganizationList section in Apsara Uni-manager Management Console Developer Guide. |
| x-acs-resourcegroupid | The ID of the resource set in the Apsara Uni- manager Management Console. For more information about how to obtain resource set IDs, see the ListResourceGroup section in Apsara Uni-manager Management Console Developer Guide. |
| x-acs-instanceid | The ID of the instance on which you want to perform operations. For example, you can obtain the ID of an Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance from the ECS instance list. |

### Obtain an AccessKey pair

**assigned by STS**

This topic describes how to use Security Token Service (STS) to make API calls.

**Background information**

Alibaba Cloud STS allows you to manage temporary credentials to your Alibaba Cloud resources. You can use STS to make API calls. An AccessKey pair assigned by STS consists of an AccessKey ID, an AccessKey secret, and a security token. When you use STS to make API calls, you must use an AccessKey pair assigned by STS.

**Procedure**

1. Obtain your `RAM role` .
i. Log on to the Apsara Uni-manager Management Console. ii. Click the profile picture in the upper-right corner of the page and click **User**
**Information**.
iii. Click **View Current Role Policy**. In the **View Policies of Current Role** dialog box, view your `RAM role` .
2. Obtain the AccessKey pair assigned by STS.

**Note**

You must use the actual values to replace the variables in the following sample code. The angle brackets <> are not retained in the final code. The following list describes the variables: <yourRegionID>: Replace it with the actual region ID. <yourAccessKeyID>: Replace it with your AccessKey ID. <yourAccessKeySecret>: Replace it with your AccessKey secret. <yourRoleSessionName>: Replace it with your current session name. In most cases, this variable is set to the identity of the user who make API calls. Example: Username. You can distinguish the users who assume the same RAM role to perform operations based on the value of the `RoleSessionName` variable. This way, you can perform user-specific auditing. The value of this variable must be 2 to 64 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, periods (.), at signs (@), hyphens (-), and underscores (_). <yourRoleArn>: Replace it with the Alibaba Cloud Resource Name (ARN) of your RAM role. "sts.aliyuns.com": Replace it with the actual endpoint of STS. Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a DefaultAcsClient instance and initialize it.
    // Replace <yourRegionID>, <yourAccessKeyID>, and <yourAccessKeySecret> with the
actual region ID, your AccessKey ID, and your AccessKey secret.
    DefaultProfile profile = DefaultProfile.getProfile("<yourRegionID>", "
<yourAccessKeyID>", "<yourAccessKeySecret>");
    HttpClientConfig clientConfig = HttpClientConfig.getDefault();
    clientConfig.setIgnoreSSLCerts(true);
    clientConfig.setProtocolType(ProtocolType.HTTPS);
    profile.setHttpClientConfig(clientConfig);
    IAcsClient client = new DefaultAcsClient(profile);
    String assumeRole = callAssumeRole(client);
    if (StringUtils.isEmpty(assumeRole)) return;
    JSONObject assumeRoleJson = JSONObject.parseObject(assumeRole);
    JSONObject credentials = assumeRoleJson.getJSONObject("Credentials");
    // Obtain the AccessKey pair assigned by STS.
    String stsAK = credentials.getString("AccessKeyId");
    String stsSK = credentials.getString("AccessKeySecret");
    String stsToken = credentials.getString("SecurityToken");
} private static String callAssumeRole(IAcsClient client) {
    CommonRequest request = new CommonRequest();
    // Replace "sts.aliyuns.com" with the endpoint of STS. The format of an STS endpo
int is sts-vpc.${global:region}.${global:internet-domain}.
    request.setSysDomain("sts.aliyuns.com");
    request.setSysProduct("Sts");
    request.setSysAction("AssumeRole");
    request.setSysVersion("2015-04-01");
    request.setSysMethod(MethodType.POST);
    request.setHttpContentType(FormatType.FORM);
    // Replace "<yourRoleSessionName>" with the actual session name.
    request.putQueryParameter("RoleSessionName", "<yourRoleSessionName>");
    // The ARN of your RAM role. Replace "<yourRoleArn>" with the ARN of your RAM rol
e that is obtained in the previous step.
    request.putQueryParameter("RoleArn", "<yourRoleArn>");
    try {
        CommonResponse response = client.getCommonResponse(request);
        return response.getData();
    } catch (ServerException e) {
        System.out.println(e.getErrCode());
        System.out.println(e.getErrMsg());
    } catch (ClientException e) {
        System.out.println(e.getErrCode());
        System.out.println(e.getErrMsg());
    }
    return null;
}
```

3. Use the AccessKey pair assigned by STS to call an operation of a cloud service. The
following sample code provides an example on how to use the AccessKey pair assigned by STS to call the `DescribeZones` operation of Elastic Compute Service (ECS): Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop

**Note**

You must use the actual values to replace the variables in the following sample code. The angle brackets <> are not retained in the final code. The following list describes the variables: <yourRegionID>: Replace it with the actual region ID. <yourAccessKeyID>: Replace it with the actual region ID.Replace it with your AccessKey ID. <yourAccessKeySecret>: Replace it with your AccessKey secret. <yourStsToken>: Replace it with the security token of the AccessKey pair assigned by STS. <yourResourceGroupID>: Replace it with the actual resource set ID. <yourResourceGroupID>: Replace it with the actual organization ID.

    request.putHeadParameter("x-acs-organizationid", "<yourOrganizationID>");
    try {
        CommonResponse response = client.getCommonResponse(request);
        System.out.println(response.getData());
    } catch (ServerException e) {
        System.out.println(e.getErrCode());
        System.out.println(e.getErrMsg());
    } catch (ClientException e) {
        System.out.println(e.getErrCode());
        System.out.println(e.getErrMsg());
    }
}
```

### Obtain an endpoint

This topic describes how to obtain the endpoint of an Apsara Stack Security service.

**Background information**

To use the POP gateway to call the API operations of a cloud service, you must specify the endpoint of the cloud service. You can obtain the endpoint from Apsara Stack onsite O&M engineers. You can also perform the following steps to obtain the endpoint.

## Call examples

### Call examples for SDK for Java

#### Quick start

This topic describes how to obtain and use Apsara Stack SDK for Java.

**Prerequisites**

An Apsara Stack tenant account that has the required permissions and an AccessKey pair that consists of an AccessKey ID and an AccessKey secret are obtained before you can use Apsara Stack SDK for Java. You can view and obtain your AccessKey pair in the Apsara Unimanager Management Console. For more information, see Obtain an AccessKey pair. For more information about how to obtain the endpoint, see Obtain an endpoint. Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or later is installed before you can use Apsara Stack SDK for Java.

**Installation**

If you use Apache Maven to manage a Java project, you need to only import the JAR file of Apsara Stack SDK for Java to the pom.xml file of the project. If you want to use Apsara Stack Security SDK for Java, you must install the core library of Apsara Stack SDK for Java. We recommend that you use V4.5.17 or later of the core library.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a DefaultAcsClient instance and initialize the instance.
        DefaultProfile profile = DefaultProfile.getProfile(
            "<your-region-id>",          // The ID of the region.
            "<your-access-key-id>",      // The AccessKey ID.
            "<your-access-key-secret>"); // The AccessKey secret.
        IAcsClient client = new DefaultAcsClient(profile);
        // Create an API request and configure the required parameters.
        CommonRequest request = new CommonRequest();
        request.setDomain("<your-endpooint>");// The endpoint of the service.
        request.setVersion("<API-version>");// The version of the API.
        request.setAction("<your-action>");// The name of the API operation.
        request.putQueryParameter("PageNumber", "1");
        request.putQueryParameter("PageSize", "30");
        try {
            CommonResponse response = client.getCommonResponse(request);
            System.out.println(response.getData());
        } catch (ServerException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (ClientException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Use SDK

##### Install SDK for Java

This topic describes how to install and use Apsara Stack Security SDK for Java. Apsara Stack SDK for Java supports Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or later. You can install Apsara Stack SDK for Java by adding Maven dependencies or downloading the SDK. For more information, visit Alibaba Cloud SDKs. If you want to use Apsara Stack Security SDK for Java, you must install the core library of Apsara Stack SDK for Java. We recommend that you use V4.5.17 or later of the core library. When you install the core library, you must add the following dependency to the pom.xml file. For more information about the specific SDK version, visit Alibaba Cloud SDKs. Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop

```xml
<!-- Alibaba Cloud SDK for Java --> <dependency>
    <groupId>com.aliyun</groupId>
    <artifactId>aliyun-java-sdk-core</artifactId>
    <version>4.5.17</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Use CommonRequest to call API operations

**Note**

If you want to call the API operations of a service that does not provide SDKs, you can use CommonRequest. You can use CommonRequest to call API operations.

**Benefits**

CommonRequest provides the following benefits:
1. Lightweight: You need to only download the core package. You do not need to download
and install SDKs of services.
2. Easy to use: You can call the newly released API operations of a service without the need to
update the SDK for the service.
3. Fast iteration.

**Use CommonRequest to call an API operation**

Apsara Stack services provide RPC and RESTful APIs. The request method of CommonRequest varies based on the style of the API that you want to call. In most cases, an API uses the RPC style if the API operations include the Action parameter. An API uses the RESTful style if the API operations include the PathPattern parameter. All API operations of a service use the same API style. The API of each service supports only one style. If you pass an invalid identifier, another API operation may be called, or the `ApiNotFound` error is returned. If you want to send a CommonRequest request, you must obtain the values of the following parameters. For more information about the values of these parameters, see the API reference in DocumentationDocumentation. You can also visit OpenAPI Explorer to obtain the parameter values of API operations for some services. Endpoint: the endpoint of a service. Version: the version of the API. The version is in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Operation information: the name of the API operation that you want to call. The APIs of most Apsara Stack services, such as Threat Detection Service, are RPC APIs. If you want to call an RPC API operation, you must obtain the value of the Action parameter, and then specify the value in the `request.ApiName = "<Action>"` format. If you want to call a RESTful API operation of a service, such as Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), you must obtain the value of the PathPattern parameter, and then specify the RESTful path in the `request.PathPattern = "<PathPattern>"` format.

**Example: Call an RPC API operation**

The following sample code shows how to use CommonRequest to call an API operation of Apsara Stack Security: Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop

```java
import com.aliyuncs.CommonRequest; import com.aliyuncs.CommonResponse; import com.aliyuncs.DefaultAcsClient; import com.aliyuncs.IAcsClient; import com.aliyuncs.exceptions.ClientException; import com.aliyuncs.exceptions.ServerException; import com.aliyuncs.profile.DefaultProfile; public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a DefaultAcsClient instance and initialize the instance.
        DefaultProfile profile = DefaultProfile.getProfile(
            "<your-region-id>",          // The ID of the region.
            "<your-access-key-id>",      // The AccessKey ID.
            "<your-access-key-secret>"); // The AccessKey secret.
        IAcsClient client = new DefaultAcsClient(profile);
        // Create an API request and specify parameters.
        CommonRequest request = new CommonRequest();
        request.setDomain("<your-endpoint>");// The endpoint of the service.
        request.setVersion("<API-version>");// The version of the API.
        request.setAction("<your-action>");// The name of the API operation.
        request.putQueryParameter("PageNumber", "1");
        request.putQueryParameter("PageSize", "30");
        try {
            CommonResponse response = client.getCommonResponse(request);
            System.out.println(response.getData());
        } catch (ServerException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (ClientException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Use SDK

##### Install SDK for Python

This topic describes how to install and use SDK for Python. Apsara Stack SDK for Python supports Python 2.6.x, Python 2.7.x, and Python 3.x or later. You can install Apsara Stack SDK for Python by using pip.

**Note**

To use the SDK of an Apsara Stack service, you must install the core library of Apsara Stack SDK for Python. If you use Python 2.x, run the following command to install the core library:

```
pip install aliyun-python-sdk-core
```

If you use Python 3.x, run the following command to install the core library:

```
pip3 install aliyun-python-sdk-core-v3
```

##### Use CommonRequest to call API operations

**Note**

If you want to call the API operations of an Apsara Stack service that does not provide SDKs, you can use CommonRequest. You can use CommonRequest to call API operations.

**Benefits**

CommonRequest provides the following benefits:
1. Lightweight: You need only to download the core package. You do not need to download
and install SDKs of Apsara Stack services.
2. Easy to use: You can call the newly released API operations of an Apsara Stack service
without the need to update the SDK for the service.
3. Fast iteration.

**Use CommonRequest to call an API operation**

Apsara Stack services provide RPC and RESTful APIs. The request method of CommonRequest varies based on the style of the API that you want to call. In most cases, an API uses the RPC style if the API operations include the Action parameter. An API uses the RESTful style if the API operations include the PathPattern parameter. All API operations of a service use the same API style. The API of each service supports only one style. If you pass an invalid identifier, another API operation may be called, or the `ApiNotFound` error is returned. If you want to send a CommonRequest request, you must obtain the values of the following parameters. For more information about the values of these parameters, see the API reference in DocumentationDocumentation. You can also visit OpenAPI Explorer to obtain the parameter values of API operations for some services. Endpoint: the endpoint of a service. Version: the version of the API. The version is in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Security Orchestration Automatio n and Response (SOAR) Develop Operation information: the name of the API operation that you want to call. The APIs of most Apsara Stack services, such as Threat Detection Service, are RPC APIs. If you want to call an RPC API operation, you must obtain the value of the Action parameter, and then specify the value in the `request.ApiName = "<Action>"` format. If you want to call a RESTful API operation of a service, such as Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), you must obtain the value of the PathPattern parameter, and then specify the RESTful path in the `request.PathPattern = "<PathPattern>"` format.

**Example: Call an RPC API operation**

The following sample code shows how to use the CommonRequest method to call the API operation:

```bash
from aliyunsdkcore.client import AcsClient from aliyunsdkcore.request import CommonRequest client = AcsClient('{your_access_key_id}', '{your_access_key_secret}', '{your_region_id}') request = CommonRequest() request.set_domain('<your-endpoint>') //The endpoint of the service. request.set_version('<API-version>') //The version of the API. request.set_action_name('<your-action>')//The name of the API operation.
# or:
# request = CommonRequest(domain='<your-endpoint>', version='<API-version>',
action_name='your-action') request.add_query_param('PageNumber', '1') request.add_query_param('PageSize', '30') response = client.do_action_with_exception(request)
```

### Call examples for SDK for Go

#### Quick start

Apsara Stack SDK for Go allows you to access services without complex coding. This topic describes how to obtain and use the SDK for Go.
